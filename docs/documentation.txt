Project 1
IGME 235-04

Goals:
-Create a good looking website to be able to use as a portofolio for job searches.
-Have a modern design
-Meet all the requirements of the project
-Eventually use it as my personal website

layout:
-simple row/column layout using flexbox
-order of sections: navbar-> name/tagline-> about me-> gallery-> project sub-sections-> footer
-most things will either align horizontally or vertically
-gallery should align horizontally and each project sub section should align vertically
-layout will change depending on how many projects will be displayed

design:
-modern professional design
-dark design consisting of only a few colors
-mostly black background and use 2 or 3 contrasting colors
-make each section almost fill the entire screen 
-use legible simple fonts (preferably from google gonts)
Alternative Designs:
-since this will mostly be seen by game companies maybe update design to be more game like
-brighter colors
-8bit fonts
-include more art

notes:
-a lot of empty space on the sides. Maybe have floating images or spread out content
-switch to gridbox when more content is added
-make my own logo using photoshop
-image sizes may vary but 400x500 is a good baseline, don't try to get bigger than that
-gallery images should be at least half the size 
-gallery should have multiple images for each project probably.
-maybe use a slideshow or carousel for the gallery

future to-dos:
-update content as necessary
-switch to grid when more content is added
-implement javascript
-turn gallery into some kind of carousel
-add floating images to the sides to fill some space
-create my logo
-change base design if I need to
