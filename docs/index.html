            <h2>From Gamer To Developer</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm a Game Developer looking to make games for the enjoyment of the people. Gaming has always been my passion ever since I was young and my flame has yet to blow out. This passion has gone from just simply playing games to now developing games. I have knowledge in programming and scripting languages such as Java and C#. Included in my toolbelt are game engines like Unity and Unreal. My goal is to build up experience in the industry in order to develop top-notch games. When I'm not polishing my development skills, you can catch me playing a variety of games from FPS and RPGs, to MOBAs and MMORPGs, you name it. </p>

            <p class="projectdescriptions"> A semester long group project created with the creative minds of 5 students. We were tasked to create a game completely from

                and playtests. Specific things I worked on in this project is: level design, UI and game states, collision detection, a tutorial level, and other smaller 
                aspects of the game.
