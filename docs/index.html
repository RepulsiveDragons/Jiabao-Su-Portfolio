            <h2>From Gamer To Developer</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm a Game Developer looking to make games for the enjoyment of the people. Gaming has always been my passion ever since I was young and my flame has yet to blow out. This passion has gone from just simply playing games to now developing games. I have knowledge in programming and scripting languages such as Java and C#. Included in my toolbelt are game engines like Unity and Unreal. My goal is to build up experience in the industry in order to develop top-notch games. When I'm not polishing my development skills, you can catch me playing a variety of games from FPS and RPGs, to MOBAs and MMORPGs, you name it. </p>

            <img class="projectimgs" src="media/space_odyssey_big.png" alt="Space Odyssey">
            <p class="projectdescriptions">This game is a rendition of the classic top down shmup/bullet hell style game. You control a space ship and try to avoid the incoming asterodis and enemy space ships. Shoot down the obstacles to gain points and survive for aslong as you can. This web browser game was written primarily in JavaScript and PixiJs, a html5 creation engine. The purpose of thos project was to create an experience using JavaScript. I had never coded in JavaScript before this but I was able to get the hang of the techniques.

            <img class="projectimgs" src="media/lfd3_big.png" alt="L4D3">
            <p class="projectdescriptions">This is very barebones game where zombies will constantly be spawning and you must survive and kill as many zombies as you can. 
                there will be other humans but they are completely defenseless. You are the only human with a gun to defend ourself. This game was inside the Unity game engine and all
                code has been written by me. The purpose of this game was to get my first experience making a game in a game engine. Most of the algorithms and logic is written from scratch without 
                using much of Unitys built in tools as the purpose of this class was to get used to how a real game pipeline would be like. The focus of this project was to utilize vector math and forces to 
                make things happpen.

            <p class="projectdescriptions">Have you wanted to easily search for any anime or manga with just one click? Have you ever want to know which animes are airing for a specific day of the week?
            Look no farther because I made a website that allows you easily search for any anime/manga that exists! This website is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScipt. The purpose of this project was to
            use an API to access and display useful information. The API I used is <a href="https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#" class="projectLinks">Jikan's myanimelist API</a>. This project is to show that I can program and use tools 
            outside of just game development.
